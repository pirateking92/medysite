# Medy's Site

## Description

Frontend project for Medy D'Avino, an Italian translator, interpreter and project manager, with language proficiency in Italian, English and Spanish.

A basis of a website has been made for her by a group called the freewebsiteguys. They have created a wordpress website for her and elementor has been implemented to make changes to the front end.

A simple design has been implemented, using a colour palette and design that Medy has chosen, with her logo being one of the main designs that she has personally created.

She hopes for the website to be somewhat similar to what it already is, but cleaned up and made to be more presentable.

I would prefer to build it from the ground up with nextjs, though will see how elementor works first, and see if that will be a quicker option. I feel that it won't allow for much customisability, but we can only see. There may be a way to convert what there is already into code, so will take a look.
